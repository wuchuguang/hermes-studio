# JEV integration and configuration contract

Every Studio business feature that uses JEV must identify its integration point,
provide its own persisted switch, and expose user-adjustable settings in the
frontend. An API key only makes the provider available; the memory master switch
must still be enabled before its configured child features can use JEV.

## Required behavior

- Register the feature in `scripts/jev-integrations.json`: a stable id, purpose,
  concrete source files, independent boolean `enabledKey`, additional `options`,
  implementation status, and regression test files.
- Each feature switch is scoped to the selected Profile and has a labeled
  frontend `NSwitch`. Studio defaults to `false` unless its registration explicitly
  declares `studioDefaultEnabled: true`. The checker requires the persisted default
  to match this declaration; standalone switches still default to `false`.
  Reusing another feature's switch or the provider credential as its activation
  condition is not allowed.
- Expose every user-adjustable JEV option through the settings API and an editable
  frontend control. This includes feature-specific thresholds, candidate limits,
  per-feature models or timeouts if introduced. Do not add backend-only knobs or
  editable controls whose values are omitted from the save request.
- Shared provider configuration (`baseUrl`, `model`, `apiKey`, `timeoutMs`) may be
  inherited. Do not duplicate it per feature unless independent overrides are
  needed. An empty `options` list explicitly means no extra feature knobs exist.
- The UI must explain the feature and any non-obvious option semantics using all
  locales. Reuse `SettingRow`, shared input sizes and theme variables. Users must
  be able to find the controls on the registered settings page.
- An active integration must check its feature switch before evaluation. Turning
  it off must stop that feature's JEV requests and preserve its original flow.
  Missing credentials and optional provider failures must preserve that flow as
  well; cancellation must still propagate. Other JEV features remain independent.
- Apply saved settings at the documented run boundary, respect Profile isolation,
  and preserve explicit `false` overrides. For standalone agents, provide the
  corresponding local config/constructor option and document the Studio mapping.
- Use Studio's public facade or the agent-owned evaluator. Business modules must
  not instantiate the provider SDK or introduce an unregistered HTTP bypass.

## Current integration

| Integration | Implementation | Studio setting | Standalone setting | Frontend entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ekko-memory` | Active: run context and fallback, `memory/jev-policy.ts` | `ekkoMemoryEnabled` | `jev.memoryEnabled` | Models → JEV → Use JEV for Ekko memory |
| `ekko-memory-kind-routing` | Active: `memory/jev-routing.ts` | `ekkoMemoryKindRoutingEnabled` | `jev.memoryKindRoutingEnabled` | Memory options → Semantic category routing |
| `ekko-memory-relevance-filter` | Active: `memory/jev-filter.ts` | `ekkoMemoryRelevanceFilterEnabled` | `jev.memoryRelevanceFilterEnabled` | Memory options → Irrelevant memory filtering |
| `ekko-memory-rerank` | Active: `memory/jev-rerank.ts` | `ekkoMemoryRerankEnabled` | `jev.memoryRerankEnabled` | Memory options → Candidate reranking |
| `ekko-memory-write-review` | Active: `memory/jev-write-review.ts` | `ekkoMemoryWriteReviewEnabled` | `jev.memoryWriteReviewEnabled` | Memory options → Review memory writes |
| `ekko-skills` | Active: `skills/jev.ts`, routing and learning preflight | `ekkoSkillsEnabled` | `jev.skillsEnabled` | Models → JEV → Use JEV for Ekko skills |

Browser integrations `browser-match` and `browser-verify` are registered independently
with default-off switches `browserMatchEnabled` and `browserVerifyEnabled` at
Models → JEV → Built-in browser automation. They share the provider connection,
with separate confidence and timeout controls plus a matching candidate limit.
Studio MCP orchestration lives in `bin/browser/jev.mjs`; server assessments use
`modules/studio/services/browser/jev.ts` and the public facade. No standalone
mapping is needed. Settings are read on every assessment, not at agent startup.
See [browser JEV behavior](../jev.md#built-in-browser-automation).

Agent source paths above are relative to `packages/ekko-agent/src`. Studio's memory
master defaults to false; its four child switches default to true. Existing saved
values, including explicit false, take precedence. Standalone Ekko retains false
defaults for every switch. Studio reads the selected Profile before each normal/isolated run;
the runtime snapshots the values for all subsequent memory operations. Shared memory
services never store a mutable JEV client or Profile configuration. No runtime
setting is written back to Ekko's local file.

Skill enhancement is one integration with two stages under one switch, as requested
for the unified skills configuration. It owns `ekkoSkillsCandidateLimit`,
`ekkoSkillsMinConfidence` and `ekkoSkillsTimeoutMs`, and remains independent of
memory. Both Studio and standalone defaults are off. Routing preserves exact
matches and adds at most three confident semantic matches. Learning preflight
only skips the existing reviewer on a confident negative; uncertain or unavailable
judgments retain it. Queued reviews capture the originating run's configuration.
See [skills JEV behavior](../../packages/ekko-agent/docs/skills-jev.md).

The parent integration owns the candidate limit, recall threshold and per-operation
time budget. Relevance filtering owns its exclusion confidence threshold and write
review owns its review threshold. All five options have editable advanced controls.
See [memory JEV behavior](../../packages/ekko-agent/docs/memory-jev.md) for the
behavioral contract. Keep `MemoryContext`, `MemoryQueryResult`, `MemoryNode` and
write result shapes compatible. Evaluation scores must not overwrite stored fields.

The settings screen's connection test and the authenticated manual evaluation
API are explicit caller actions, rather than automatically enabled business
features. Core settings, transport, exports and SDK adapters are narrowly listed
as infrastructure in the checker; this list is not a place to exempt new features.
Runtime/setup files are exempt only while they perform configuration wiring. A
new evaluation call there must be registered as a business integration as well.

## Mechanical checks

`npm run harness:check` runs `scripts/jev-harness.mjs` in the existing Build CI.
It reads TypeScript and Vue syntax, including real template bindings, and checks:

1. JEV imports/calls, runtime evaluator access and known HTTP entry points in
   server, client, standalone agent, Desktop and MCP `bin/` source have a registered owner.
2. Each integration declares its own boolean switch, matching Studio default and
   concrete source/test paths; a configuration-only integration cannot directly evaluate.
3. Settings declared by defaults and server/client interfaces are registered,
   accepted by the save API, returned by the read API, bound to editable controls,
   included in the frontend save request, and labeled in every locale. The form
   must also remain mounted on its declared host page.
4. Feature options have an integration owner, and the current standalone switch
   retains its disabled default and explicit Studio-to-agent mapping.

This is a structural architecture check, not whole-program data-flow analysis.
It does not prove that an arbitrary runtime branch correctly gates every request,
that a conditional UI control is reachable for every user, or that a declared test
covers its feature. Keep the following behavioral tests and review requirements.
If a legitimate refactor changes the checked syntax, update the checker and its
positive/negative fixtures together instead of exempting the business module.

## Adding an integration

1. Add the persisted switch and any new options to server validation/defaults and
   the non-secret settings response, plus the frontend settings type.
2. Add controls and save wiring on the JEV page, with locale labels. Register their
   component types, bindings and label keys under `settings.fields`; give every
   non-shared field an integration owner.
3. Register the integration's source files, switch, options and tests. Implement
   the switch check at the evaluation boundary and preserve the existing fallback.
4. Test disabled/no-credential behavior with zero upstream requests; enabled
   behavior; optional provider failure; explicit disabling after enabling; saved
   setting refresh; Profile isolation; and overrides without write-back where
   applicable. Verify frontend save/reload and Profile switching in Playwright.
5. Run `npm run harness:check`, `npm run test -- tests/server/jev-harness.test.ts`,
   feature tests, and the relevant browser tests/build. The PR must describe the
   configuration entry point, defaults, effective timing, and fallback behavior.

The harness test suite deliberately removes switches, save fields, controls,
locale labels and runtime mappings, and introduces unregistered/aliased callers,
to verify that these regressions fail the check. Filesystem discovery is tested
against a small isolated repository. The full repository scan runs in the separate
`npm run harness:check` CI step, keeping coverage tests independent of repository
size and avoiding a duplicate full scan under their per-test timeout.

Memory routing and reranking share the registered candidate limit and recall
threshold (default 0.5). Relevance filtering shares the candidate limit and the
category request, but owns its exclusion confidence threshold (default 0.8): valid
uncertain decisions keep that card, while malformed answers or provider failures
restore the complete original recall. Write review retains its independent confidence threshold
(default 0.8). Missing legacy recall settings inherit the new default; saved write
thresholds are preserved. All numeric thresholds require frontend controls and
round-trip tests.

## Studio sidecar infrastructure

Studio business features that evaluate JEV after their baseline operation may use
`createJevSidecar` from the public facade. The sidecar is infrastructure, not an
integration switch: PRs that call the factory must still register their concrete
business source, independent Profile switch, options, frontend controls and tests.

The sidecar accepts only statically registered adapters. An adapter parses its
non-secret policy from the same private Profile settings read that creates the
provider snapshot, supplies a bounded admission ceiling and call counts, and
rechecks an explicit source/authorization expectation before every real provider
dispatch and before application. A snapshot freezes calculation parameters; it
never freezes permission. Opaque handles cannot be serialized or reused after the
task ends.

Sidecar consumers must preserve these constraints:

- `trySchedule` is synchronous, bounded and never performs provider/config IO.
- The complete request is validated and limited to 64,000 UTF-8 bytes. Queue input
  is plain bounded JSON; accessors, custom `toJSON`, cycles and non-finite values
  are rejected.
- Cumulative deadlines include queue and settings/authority reads. A logical
  timeout does not free a physical request slot until the real operation settles.
- All request state is untrusted data. Questions and finite candidate/evidence IDs
  are constructed by trusted code and validated again after evaluation.
- Result application uses the registered adapter's synchronous typed apply port.
  It must perform its domain CAS/claim in a short transaction; thenables are
  rejected. A fatal skip, cancellation or successful apply cannot be resumed.
- Every evaluation, revision generation and apply rechecks the current feature
  switch and credentials. Stage-specific switches (revision and auto routing)
  are checked separately; disabling them prevents late results from applying.
  Auto routing must use `ctx.apply`, including a fresh message hash check inside
  the queue/claim transaction. Incomplete or non-finite JEV answers are terminal
  skips, never permission to execute.
- Revision generation uses `ctx.generate` with its own 30-second budget and a
  process-wide physical slot. Its elapsed time preserves the remaining JEV
  allowance, but cannot extend a parent deadline. Pass the generation signal
  into the model runtime and call `beforeDispatch` at the provider fetch boundary.
  A hung generation retains its physical slot after logical timeout/cancellation.
- Workflow observations carry the run deadline, recheck persisted cancellation
  before dispatch/application, and cancel locally when the run is stopped.
  Completed nodes in completed/failed runs remain eligible; canceled runs do not.
- Sidecar diagnostics contain only stable IDs, hashes, counts, durations and
  reason codes. Secrets, source text and provider bodies are excluded.

The sidecar does not provide durable tasks, cluster-wide provider-call
at-most-once, summary CAS, workflow quality storage or group routing claims. Those
remain requirements of each registered business integration.
